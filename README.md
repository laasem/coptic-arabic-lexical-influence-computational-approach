# Coptic Lexical Influence on Egyptian Arabic: A Computational Approach

A computational approach to the [1964 paper "Coptic Lexical Influence on Egyptian Arabic" by Wilson B. Bishai](https://www.jstor.org/stable/543178).

## Dependencies
python3 needs to be installed on the environment you will run the script in (local, cloud, etc.) via command `python3`.

## Run
Assuming python3 is installed via command `python3`, navigate to current directory and run:

```
source .env/bin/activate
python3 script.py
```

to run script in a local virtual environment.

When done, run `source .env/bin/deactivate` to deactivate virtual environment.
